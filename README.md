Slides from my talk, "Don’t reinvent the wheel: making use of shiny extension packages", at a Münster R User Group [event](https://www.meetup.com/Munster-R-Users-Group/events/257889907/).

The slides contain links and images related to various shiny extension packages (shinyverse?) that make building fancy shiny apps easier!
